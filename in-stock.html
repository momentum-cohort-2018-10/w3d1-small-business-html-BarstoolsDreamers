    <h2>Wild hyacinth</h2>
    <p>This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens. 
    The bulb grows best in well-drained soil high in humus. 
    It will grow in lightly shaded forest areas and on rocky outcrops as well as in open meadows or prairies. 
    Additionally it is found growing alongside streams and rivers. The plants may be divided in autumn after 
    the leaves have withered. Bulbs should be planted in the autumn. Additionally the plant spreads by 
    seed rather than by runners.

    <h2>Lily-of-the-Valley</h2>
    <p>With its deeply fragrant flowers -- scallop-edge bells that dangle above bright emerald-green leaves -- 
    this nearly deer-proof shade lover appears to be delicate in an old-fashioned way. But the pretty plant 
    is also an intrepid wanderer, spreading readily and rapidly, and anyone who gardens in a small space 
    will want to watch this perennial to make sure it stays in bounds. Tolerates shade well. 
    <strong>Warning: this plant is poisonous.</strong>
